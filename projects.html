  <h2>Custom Task List Manager</h2>

  <p>I encountered a process at work that involved combining excel spreadsheets from customers into our own and
    generating a new file. This process was laborious and a single file could take all day to complete. I wrote a
    program that would take the customer data formatted in an input file, and produce new Excel files with all of the
    necesary information. A single file could take over a day to complete, but now it takes about 30 minutes. The
    program was written in Java with the NetBeans IDE.</p>

  <h2>Training Library</h2>

  <p>I created a professional training library of over twenty videos detailing all aspects of the company software.
    These videos ranged from user videos explaining how to reset password, to administrative topics regarding security.
    I craeted these videos with professional tools including Premiere Pro, After Effects, Audition, and photoshop. I
    also used Envato Elements to bring in premade assets for the production.

  <h2>Pixel Race Software</h2>
  <p>I had the idea of creating an animation tool to race thousands of characters within a pixelated environment. The
    tool needed to handle collision detection for thousands of characters and manage sound and graphics. The software
    was built in Adobe Animate using ActionScript 3.0.</p>
